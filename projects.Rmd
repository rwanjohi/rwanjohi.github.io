Sometimes I like to do projects and then post them on the internet for the whole world to benefit!
here's some examples. 

## [Sentiment Analysis](https://rwanjohi.shinyapps.io/myprojects/)

- Statistical and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed to analyze sentiments. The sentiments are are obtained via tweeter, facebook, emails, letters, ...

- After the data is cleansed, descriptive statitics (both graphical and numerical) are computed.

- Next, the sentiments are classified -using ML models- either as positive, neutral or negative. The ML models utilized include: Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM and MAXENT.

- Finaly, whenever possible, the sentiments are mapped on a geographical map.

## [Deep Learning with Keras and Tensorflow in R](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/finally-deep-learning-keras-tensorflow-r-richard-wanjohi-ph-d/)

- This article demonstrate how to use Keras and Tensorflow to run Deep Learning models in R.
- R launched Keras in R, a comprehensive library which runs on top of Tensorflow, with both CPU and GPU capabilities 
- The package creates conda instances and install all Keras requirements in R environment. 
- Deep Learning models supported by the package include Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM), Convoluted Neural Network (CNN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) , VGG-like convnet, Skip-Gram models among others.


## [GitHub](https://github.com/rwanjohi)

- I can code!
