Here are some of my projects:


## [Sentiment Analysis](https://rwanjohi.shinyapps.io/myprojects/)

- Statistical and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed to analyze sentiments. The sentiments are are obtained via tweeter, facebook, emails, letters, ...

- After the data is cleansed, descriptive statitics (both graphical and numerical) are computed.

- Next, the sentiments are classified -using ML models- either as positive, neutral or negative. The ML models utilized include: Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM and MAXENT.

- Finaly, whenever possible, the sentiments are mapped on a geographical map.

## [Deep Learning with Keras and Tensorflow in R](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/finally-deep-learning-keras-tensorflow-r-richard-wanjohi-ph-d/)

- This article demonstrate how to use Keras and Tensorflow to run Deep Learning models in R.

- R launched Keras in R, a comprehensive library which runs on top of Tensorflow, with both CPU and GPU capabilities. 

- The package creates conda instances and install all Keras requirements in R environment. 

- Deep Learning models supported by the package include Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM), Convoluted Neural Network (CNN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) , VGG-like convnet, Skip-Gram models among others.

## [Is the intense data preparation necessary?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/significant-project-time-being-spent-data-preparation-wanjohi-ph-d/)

- I presented some arguements why the intense data cleansing and manipulation \textit{may} not be neccessary 

## [GitHub](https://github.com/rwanjohi)

- I can code!
