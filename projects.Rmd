Sometimes I like to do projects and then post them on the internet for the whole world to benefit!
here's some examples. 

## [Sentiment Analysis](https://rwanjohi.shinyapps.io/myprojects/)

- Statistical and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed to analyze sentiments. The sentiments are are obtained via tweeter, facebook, emails, letters, ...

- After the data is cleansed, descriptive statitics (both graphical and numerical) are computed.

- Next, the sentiments are classified -using ML models- either as positive, neutral or negative. The ML models utilized include: Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM and MAXENT.

- Finaly, whenever possible, the sentiments are mapped on a geographical map.
